Hello This is an exposition to some of the projects to automate so on and so forth


#Project 1: Data Science NLP LDA Model: Project Overview
Texts have become one of the most ubiquitous forms of marketing data in the digital economy. Perhaps nowhere is this more salient than in the online reviews domain. In this module, we examined how natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to Honda car reviews. This dataset is available in Kaggle and requires some cleansing and preparation beforehand.

Questions to answer:
-Are the reviews usually facts or opinion based?
-What are some topics to think when buying a Honda vehicle?
-Are the topics correlating with the ratings?
